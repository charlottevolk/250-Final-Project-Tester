# 250-Final-Project-Tester

Tester for COMP 250 final project.

XML files created with a script courtesy of James Xu .

To use:
- MyTester.java goes with your other classes in the src file
- XML files go at the same level as src (not inside it)
- ExpectedOutput.rtf is to compare your output

Note: Includes test.xml, the cyclic test file from class, and tests for correctness of assigned ranks for that file
